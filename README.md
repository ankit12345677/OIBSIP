# OIBSIP (Oasis at InofyByte Internship Project)

In this repository, I am sharing my internship work with Oasis at InofyByte company.

During this project, I have completed the Level 1 tasks assigned by the Oasis Infobyte team. The tasks include:

1. Creating a responsive landing page based on the provided demo.
2. Developing a portfolio, which was a relatively straightforward task for me. I implemented this using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
3. Building a temperature converter website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I approached the creation of this website with my best efforts and process.
